Building a mobile-responsive dashboard with a **hamburger menu** and a **layered donut emotion wheel** is a classic "Senior UI" challenge. Since you are using a full-stack setup with Next.js and Tailwind, here is the technical roadmap for those two specific features.

### 1. The Mobile-First Hamburger Menu

In a dashboard, the sidebar is usually a "Permanent Drawer" on desktop and a "Hidden Hamburger" on mobile.

* **Logic:** Use a `useState` hook to track the `isOpen` state.
* **Tailwind Strategy:** * **Desktop:** Sidebar has a fixed width (e.g., `w-64`) and stays visible (`hidden md:block`).
* **Mobile:** Sidebar is positioned absolutely (`absolute`), starts off-screen (`-translate-x-full`), and slides in when the hamburger is clicked (`translate-x-0`).


* **The "Header" approach:** On mobile, your sidebar links move into the hamburger, but your **Profile Avatar** and **Settings** should stay in a small top-header for quick access.

### 2. The Layered Donut "Emotion Wheel"

A layered donut chart (also called a **Nested Donut** or **Sunburst**) is perfect for emotions because it can show "Primary Emotions" (inner ring) and "Intensity" or "Blends" (outer rings).

* **Tech Stack:** Use **D3.js** for maximum control or **Recharts** for speed.
* **Implementation Steps:**
1. **Inner Ring:** Represents core categories (e.g., Joy, Anger, Fear).
2. **Outer Ring(s):** Represents sub-emotions or intensity levels (e.g., under "Joy," the outer layer could show "Serenity" vs. "Ecstasy").
3. **Color Sync:** Map your Plutchik color variables (Red for Anger, Yellow for Joy) to each specific "arc" in the chart.


* **UX Tip:** Make the rings **interactive**. If a user clicks the "Anger" slice, the rest of the dashboard (the Care Corner and History) should filter to show only Anger-related data.

### 3. Dashboard Structure: Bento Grid vs. Single Column

* **On Desktop:** Keep the **Bento Grid** (modular tiles). It maximizes screen real estate and looks professional.
* **On Mobile:** The Bento Grid must **"collapse"** into a single column.
* **Prioritization:** The "Thought Engine" (Input) stays at the top.
* **Visualization:** The "Emotion Wheel" stays visible, but secondary data (like the Activity Heatmap) should be moved to a separate "History" tab or placed further down the scroll to reduce cognitive load.

### Your Next Step in Development

To begin the implementation, you'll need the **System Prompts** for your AI agents (Counselor vs. Brutally Honest) to ensure the analysis data matches your layered donut structure.
